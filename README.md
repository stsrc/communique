# events

This was project for linux kernel driver course. Idea of project was to create  
IPC, which could pass some messages. It is not ideal though: I've created some  
strange algorithm to check if deadlock occure. It is bad in context of  
complexity. Maybe there should be used binary tree to get faster algorithm.
